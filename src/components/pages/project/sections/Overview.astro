            <div class="prose prose-lg text-muted-foreground space-y-4">
              <p>
                Eric Reyes, a professional barber known for his precision and
                style, lacked an online presence that matched the quality of his
                work. His previous social media pages showcased his skills but
                didn’t provide a professional platform for clients to explore
                his services or book appointments easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without a dedicated website, potential clients struggled to find
                detailed information, view his portfolio, or contact him
                directly. Eric needed a sleek, modern portfolio that reflected
                his craftsmanship and helped him build trust with new customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal was clear: create a personal brand website that
                highlights his expertise, showcases his best transformations,
                and makes booking an effortless experience for every client.
              </p>

            <Image class="h-64 object-contain" src={EricReyesMac} alt="" />
            <Image class="h-64 object-contain" src={EricReyesIphone} alt="" />
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <div class="prose prose-lg text-muted-foreground space-y-4">
              <p>
                Our approach focused on crafting a modern, mobile-first
                portfolio that captures Eric Reyes’s professionalism and
                artistic style. We started by analyzing how potential clients
                search for barbers online and what inspires trust and conversion
                in personal service websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new design features clean navigation, bold visuals of Eric’s
                best work, and a seamless appointment booking flow. Clients can
                easily browse his services, view transformations, and schedule a
                session—all from any device.
              </p>
              <p>
                Visually, the site combines minimal aesthetics with
                high-contrast photography to highlight the precision and detail
                of his craft. Every section was built to reinforce Eric’s
                personal brand while keeping the user experience simple and
                intuitive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, we optimized the website for local SEO, helping
                Eric rank higher in barber-related searches in his area and
                attract a steady stream of new clients.
