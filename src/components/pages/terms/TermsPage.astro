          <p>
            These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the
            laws of Sweden, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
          </p>

          <h3>13.2 Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            In the event of any dispute arising from these Terms or our
            engagement:
          </p>
          <ol>

              <strong>Negotiation:</strong> We agree to first attempt to resolve
              the dispute through good-faith negotiation
            </li>
            <li>

          </ol>

          <h3>13.3 Language</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms are written in English. In case of any discrepancies

            prevail.

        <!-- Miscellaneous -->
        <section>
          <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>

          <h3>14.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms, together with any project-specific agreements and
            quotations, constitute the entire agreement between us and supersede
            all prior agreements, understandings, and representations.
          </p>

          <h3>14.2 Amendments</h3>
          <p>
            I may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted
            on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. For ongoing
            services, you will be notified of material changes at least 30 days
            in advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continued use of my services after changes constitutes acceptance of
            the new Terms.
          </p>

          <h3>14.3 Severability</h3>
          <p>
            If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or
            invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
            extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in full
            force and effect.
          </p>

          <h3>14.4 Waiver</h3>
          <p>
            No waiver of any term or condition shall be deemed a further or
            continuing waiver of such term or any other term. My failure to
            enforce any right or provision shall not constitute a waiver of such
            right or provision.
          </p>

          <h3>14.5 Assignment</h3>
          <p>
            You may not assign or transfer these Terms or any rights hereunder
            without my prior written consent. I may assign these Terms to any
            successor entity in the event of a merger or acquisition.
          </p>

          <h3>14.6 Independent Contractor</h3>
          <p>
            I am an independent contractor and not an employee, partner, or
            agent of yours. Nothing in these Terms creates an employment,
            partnership, or agency relationship.
